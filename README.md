Project Summary
CEiVoice is an AI-enhanced Support Ticket Management System designed to streamline and automate the initial processing of user requests. The system captures requests submitted via a simple form (email and message) and leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the content, automatically generating a draft ticket complete with a suggested title, category, summary, resolution path, and the appropriate assignee. This allows administrators and support staff to focus on resolution rather than categorization and assignment. CEiVoice supports a full ticket lifecycle, from initial draft consolidation (for mass issues) and submission, through status updates, collaboration, reassignment, and comprehensive reporting. The ultimate goal is to increase the efficiency of the support team and improve communication with users.

Main Steps
Ticket Initiation (The User)
Submission: The user submits a support request through a simplified form, providing only their email and a description of the issue.
Capture: CEiVoice receives the message and immediately prepares it for processing.
AI Automated Processing (The System)
Intelligence Analysis: The AI analyzes the content of the message to understand the intent and urgency.
Draft Generation: The system automatically populates a draft ticket with:
A concise Title and Summary.
An appropriate Category.
A suggested Solution.
The most suitable Assignee.
Administrative Management (The Support Staff)
Review & Consolidation: Admins review the AI-generated drafts. For widespread problems, they can consolidate multiple related drafts into a single "mass issue" ticket.
Activation: The admin confirms the details and submits the draft into the active ticket lifecycle.
Lifecycle Management: The support team manages the ticket through various stages:
Updating Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved).
Collaborating with team members or reassigning tasks as needed.
Resolution & Optimization (The System)
Communication: The system facilitates ongoing communication back to the user until the issue is closed.
Reporting: The system built-in reporting tools to analyze support efficiency and identify trends to improve future performance.
